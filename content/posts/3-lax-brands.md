## Old Days

Back in the old days (late 80’s- early 00ss) the lacrosse brand options were basic and simple. (Without causing your brain spin and have a migraine). Your options were pretty much the following:

- [STX](https://www.stx.com/)
- [Brine](https://www.brine.com/) - (owned by New Balance, re-branded as women only)
- [Warrior](https://www.warrior.com/Lacrosse) - (owned by New Balance )

There were of course other small brands like Gait, Shamrock, but they were way less prominent.

During this time it seemed to me that the top of these Brands were STX, and Warrior in terms of quality. Brine heads always seemed flimsy and would break easily. Now the main glaring hole in terms of quality was in buying complete sticks from any of these companies. This hole was the poorly stung pockets which came with these sticks. Instead of buying complete sticks you would usually buy each item adhoc shaft, head, and string kit and then hope you had a friend that could string it well for you. The other option was getting stick heads custom strung at places like LaxWorld and or Bacharach, remember the [rocket pocket](https://rock-itpocket.com/info/rock-it-pockets/classic-2/)?.

The big box brand stores like STX, Brine (Warrior was a small brand earlier than 2002) would create pockets that were either tennis rackets and or threw terribly (straight down). This trend continues today with the big corporate brands of lacrosse companies.

## Today

This brings us to today 2023 (wow I’m old) where many lacrosse businesses popped up to fill this exact void of crummy pockets with pre-strung heads. It’s a very refreshing trend that has taken the pain away from purchasing a lacrosse head or stick and it just works. This is especially wonderful if your string skills are not that great (wave, although [it's very relaxing and fun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QhNACCmrZzo)).

In my shallow research it appears this trend may have started in 2005-2011 when Maverik, StringKing and East Coast Dyes were founded. Each of these companies have their sticks hand strung (or seem hand-string) before they are shipped out by real players and or following a template made by players. My own personal first exposure to this was purchasing an ECD Rebel Offense, ECD Mirage and a Maverik heads / sticks.

ECD and StringKing make of the best string kits on the market. These kits can be purchased at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/?&_encoding=UTF8&tag=cread04-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=c569e67d0eab0fd112e44c8a99019571&camp=1789&creative=9325), [Walmart](https://www.walmart.com/search?q=StringKing) (online or local store), and [Dicks Sporting Goods](https://www.dickssportinggoods.com/c/lacrosse). Always keep an eye out on out of season clearance section in walmart. You can seriously score big time one clearance sticks (be careful not always good), and string kits.

## TLDR

### Big Box vs Quality Strung

Big Box

- [STX](https://www.stx.com/)
- [Warrior](https://www.warrior.com/Lacrosse) - (owned by New Balance ) They make great helmets.
- [Under Armour](https://www.underarmour.com/en-us/) - Not sure if they are still making heads
- [Nike](https://www.nike.com/w/lacrosse-heads-aokuk) (Usually at Dicks)

Quality Strung:

- [Maverik](https://maveriklacrosse.com/) - Make awesome pads and gloves.
- [ECD](https://ecdlax.com/)
- [StringKing](https://stringking.com/)
- [Powell](https://www.powelllacrosse.com)
- [Gait](https://gaitlaxofficial.com/) - (make sure its a legal stick they have been know to push the limits of lax technology)
- [EPOCH](https://www.epochlacrosse.com/)

I’m sure I am missing a few in both categories but this is sufficient for now
