## Helmet Fit

This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HQdzp691bU&t=1s) does perfect justice to describing everything you need to know. I've been taught to do the bottom straps first; but I think it doesn't matter as long as you do top or bottom first.

Key Points:

- Eyes look through top bars near visor
- Once good, tighten back helmet
- Then adjust straps top then bottom, or bottom then top.

If you can't get the helmet to fit correctly the odds are the helmet is too small. This usually happens with youth helmets (they grow quick.)

## Mouth Guard

Mouth guards are super important if you want to keep your dental bills down and your kids with a nice smile. The biggest thing I see is kids not wearing their mouth guards cause they don't fit correctly or can't breathe. Second, this sport is highly dependent on your kids ability to communicate with the team. If they can't speak due to the mouth guard then they will not excel.

This is why I recommend the Sisu above all else for mouth guards. The fitment is exactly like a retainer and still keeps them protected.
