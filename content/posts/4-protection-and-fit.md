## Helmet Fit

This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HQdzp691bU&t=1s) does perfect justice to describing everything you need to know. I've been taught to do the bottom straps first; but I think it doesn't matter as long as you do top or bottom first.

Key Points:

- Eyes look through top bars near visor
- Once good, tighten back helmet
- Then adjust straps top then bottom, or bottom then top.

If you can't get the helmet to fit correctly the odds are the helmet is too small. This usually happens with youth helmets (they grow quick.)
