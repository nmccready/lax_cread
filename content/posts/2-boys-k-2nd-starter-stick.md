Since I began coaching the littles back in 2021 I consistently recommend [String Complete JR (now 2)](https://stringking.com/mens-lacrosse/sticks/complete-2-jr/?sku=complete-2-jr-legend-jr-a-105-type-3s-black-black) for all newbie littles. The key features that sets your child up for success are:

- consistent pocket that has little to no whip
- wider head making catching passes easier
- thinner shaft (A105) idea for smaller hands

Another tip to incoming laxers is to buy more than one stick as they break and a backup is ideal.
