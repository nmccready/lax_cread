Since I began coaching young lacrosse players in 2021, I have consistently recommended the [String Complete JR 2](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0778VH4Y8/ref=twister_B0778XR9X8?_encoding=UTF8&th=1&_encoding=UTF8&=cread04-20&=ur2&=19d0ec9d2a86da827b20ccd38ec4881b&=1789&=9325) for all beginners. The key features that set your child up for success are:

- A consistent pocket with little to no whip
- A pocket that can be adjusted if need be (usually perfect as is)
- A wider head that makes catching passes easier
- A thinner shaft (A105) that is ideal for smaller hands

Another tip for new lacrosse players is to buy more than one stick, as they are prone to breaking. Having a backup stick is ideal.

When starting out in this sport, it is crucial to have a great stick. I know you just spent a lot of money on [usalacrosse](https://usalacrosse.com), league registration, pads, helmet, etc. However, the single most important piece of equipment is the stick and you should not cheap out. This can make or break your child's experience.
