## Introduction

I am Coach McCready, and I have been involved in lacrosse since 2018. In December 2018, I met the head varsity and junior varsity lacrosse coaches at Cosby High School at a Ravens playoff party. I offered to help, and the rest is history. In the nearly five years since then, I have enjoyed coaching and playing lacrosse in the following capacities:

- 2032-2033 [FCA Richmond Lacrosse](https://www.fcarichmondlacrosse.com/) Head Coach, 2023-2024

Throughout this journey, I have strived to learn as much about lacrosse as possible. As with anything, the game is constantly evolving, and there is always something new to learn. Coaching and giving back to the game has been one of the most rewarding experiences of my life. There is nothing quite like giving back to something that has given you so much. The other great aspect of this game is the people you meet along the wayâ€”coaches, parents, players, and more. I am grateful for the opportunity to be a part of the lacrosse community.

### Younger Years

During my younger years I exclusively played goalie. I always loved the game but due to shyness / anxiety, and health I never tried another position until much older (39). If had of played other positions than my clearing game would not have suffered.

**This is a one of the reasons that I try to push most young players away from playing goalie exclusively.**

#### Why Blog?

Every season coaching parents like to have background about myself and or my recommendations for lacrosse. Instead of sending out the same email, I decided it was time to share these things more publicly.
