## Introduction

Who am I you may ask? I am coach McCready and I have been knee deep back into lacrosse since 2018. In Dec 2018 by chance, I ran into the head varsity and jv lacrosse coaches at Cosby highschool at a Raven's playoff party. I had a great time and in conversations I asked if they needed help, the rest is history. Now almost 5 years later I have been enjoying the creators game as:

Along this journey I have tried to soak up as much lacrosse knowledge that I should have gained in my younger years. As with everything the game is every changing and there always seems to be something new to learn

Coaching and giving the game to others has been one of the most fulfilling things I have ever done. Giving yourself to something of a bigger cause then yourself is awesome. The other great aspect of this game is the friends you make along the way coaches, parents, players, and the list goes on.

### Younger Years

During my younger years I exclusively played goalie. I always loved the game but due to shyness / anxiety, and health I never tried another position until much older (39).

#### Why Blog?

Every season coaching parents like to have background about myself and or my recommendations for lacrosse. Instead of sending out the same email, I decided it was time to share these things more publicly as well as monetize on the lacrosse equipment I recommend.
